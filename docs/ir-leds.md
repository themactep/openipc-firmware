IR LEDs (Infrared Ray Light-Emitting Diode Array)
-------------------------------------------------

Many older image sensors cannot see well in dark environment, so they need
help at nighttime, a light source to highlight the scenery. Luckily, the
sensitivity of image sensors covers a much wider range of wavelengths than
that of a human eye. So the scenery can be highlighted with lights emitting
waves in a specter invisible to the human eye but effective to get a clear
image from the sensor. Usually it is the infrared range of light waves from
850nm to 940nm.

Infrared LEDs can be of different beam angle to better suite the lens on the
camera. Thus 45째 angle LEDs are better for 8mm lens, 60째 angle LEDs are better
for 6mm lens, 80째 angle LEDs are better for 4mm lens, and 90째 angle LEDs are
better for 3.6mm lens and wider.

Often, the infrared LED array equipped with an LDR (light-dependent resistor,
photo-resistor, photocell), a cadmium sulphide (CdS) sensor which reads the
ambient illumination status and switches LEDs on and off accordingly,
automatically and independently.

Usually, an IR LED array module has two ports: a 2.0mm 12V connector for
supplying power to the LEDs, and a 1.25mm CDS port to report LDR status back
to the camera so that can switch between Day and Night Vision Mode opening or
closing the IR-CUT filter to let infrared light to the sensor.
