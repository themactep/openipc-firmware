config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_ASIX
	bool "ASIX AX8817X USB"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
         the ASIX AX88xxx family of USB 2.0 chipsets. These chipsets are found
         in many popular USB-to-Ethernet adapters.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_ASIX_179_178A
	bool "ASIX AX88179_178A USB"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
          Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
          the ASIX AX88179/178A USB 3.0 chipsets. These chipsets are found in
          USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapters.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_CDC_ETHER
	bool "CDC_ETHER"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable support for CDC-Ethernet (Communications
         Device Class), a standard USB protocol for Ethernet networking over USB.
         This allows communication with devices that implement the CDC-Ethernet
         protocol, such as USB network adapters and embedded devices. CDC-Ethernet
         is widely supported across operating systems as a standard way to
         provide network connectivity over USB.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_USB_DIRECT_NCM
	bool "CDC-NCM"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable support for CDC-NCM (Network Control Model),
         a USB protocol that provides high-speed Ethernet networking. When enabled,
         this device acts as a DHCP server and assigns IP addresses to other
         devices that connect to it over USB. CDC-NCM is commonly used in modern
         cellular modems and offers better performance than older protocols
         like RNDIS.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_USB_DIRECT_NCM_CLIENT
	bool "CDC-NCM-CLIENT"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable CDC-NCM (Network Control Model) client mode.
         When enabled, this device will operate as a client that receives an IP
         address when connected to a CDC-NCM host device. For example, when
         connected to a router or gateway operating in CDC-NCM host mode, this
         device will obtain network connectivity from that host. This is the
         opposite of CDC-NCM host mode where this device provides addresses to
         others.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_R8152
	bool "Realtek 8152"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable support for USB network adapters based on
         the Realtek RTL8152/RTL8153 chipsets.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_RNDIS
	bool "RNDIS"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	help
         Select this option to enable support for RNDIS (Remote Network
         Driver Interface Specification) over USB. This allows Ethernet-style
         networking with USB devices that support the RNDIS protocol, such as
         smartphones in USB tethering mode or cellular modems that expose an
         RNDIS interface.

config BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET_WWAN_SERIAL
	bool "WWAN via USB SERIAL"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_USBNET
	select BR2_PACKAGE_PPPD
	help
          Select this option to enable support for Wireless WAN (WWAN) devices
          that connect via USB serial interfaces, such as LTE/4G modems.
          This automatically enables the Point-to-Point Protocol daemon (pppd)
          which is required for establishing cellular data connections with
          these devices.
